      BCET has a distinctive mission and history that set us apart from other institutions when we started Bangalore Educational Trust almost two decades ago. We envisioned a new kind of academic institution-one that could put it, "serve the times and the nation's needs." </p>

      <p>Our efforts for innovating curriculum, percolating research culture, supporting our innovative student teams and upgrading our infrastructure with a vision and commitment to move further on the pathways of excellence perhaps is what made BCET to climb to be a top class institution in the region. It must be highly satisfying that our stake holders namely, the Industry, Government and the people in the community have acknowledged their recognition of the spirit of excellence of our institution as it is truly reflected in our endeavor to provide value based education. </p>

        <p>Faith in the name of our institution, the Government and the society recognizes the value of goodness that is cultivated in this institution in plenty by its students, teachers and all those who are part and parcel of this institution. I am sure our achievements will make feel everyone of us proud. Our alumni here in India and abroad will feel proud of our achievements and this must invigorate our mind and soul to commit for even higher levels of achievements in the ensuing years. </p>
